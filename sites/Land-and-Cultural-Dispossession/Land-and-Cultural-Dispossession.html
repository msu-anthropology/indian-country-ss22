      <h1>Dual Disposession and Capital Accumulation</h1>
      <h3>Anishinaabe Three Fires Confederacy</h3>
      <h4><em>Cate Dombrowski</em></h4>
        <h3>What is Dual Disposession?</h3>
		        <p>From the moment colonizers stepped foot in America, indigenous Americans have faced dispossession. Colonizers believed that it was their right and duty to expand across this landscape, a belief referred to as Manifest Destiny. Engagements between the two groups during this time were often incredibly violent, “strong military forces were frequently utilized against American Indians” and the United States government paid scalp bounties to encourage colonizers to kill American Indians <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf">[1]</a>. Indigenous dispossession can be described as dual dispossession; intertwining and compounding cultural and land dispossession. Cultural and land dispossession are both inextricably linked to each other and to economics. Dual dispossession is not just something that happens incidentally, it was designed to facilitate colonial capital accumulation. Capital is first and foremost wealth. Wealth in the form of assets like land or money. Accumulation of capital is done with the purpose of reinvesting those assets to fund expanded capital accumulation. It is a far more important part of colonial relations to indigenous people than is widely thought. Many believe that white supremacy is the only driving factor of violent dispossession of indigenous people, but white supremacy is only the justification for accumulating capital through such violence.

        <h3>History of Dual Dispossession</h3>
    		    <p>Cultural dispossession is a product of the assimilationist policies of the late 1800’s. Assimilationists believed that forcing indigenous people to live within the bounds of “mainstream white society including farming, Christianization, the English language, concepts such as democracy and private property, and eventually U S citizenship” would be the best way to keep indigenous people from hindering the expansion of colonial America <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="U.S. Department of the Interior. (2021). President Ulysses S. Grant and federal Indian policy (U.S. National Park Service). National Parks Service.https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-and-federal-indian-policy.htm">[10]</a>. President Ulysses S Grant was decisively assimilationist and began to implement policies federally to assimilate indigenous people to white culture. Grant also implemented a “peace policy” which dictated management of reservations to “various Christian dominations” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="U.S. Department of the Interior. (2021). President Ulysses S. Grant and federal Indian policy (U.S. National Park Service). National Parks Service. https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-and-federal-indian-policy.htm ">[10]</a>. Assimilation was facilitated by Indian Boarding Schools, a model created by Richard Pratt. Pratt opened the first Indian boarding school in 1879. Pratt took indigenous prisoners of war, cut them off from their ancestral homeland by sending them to a boarding school where their hair was cut, they wore uniforms, and were forced to learn English and practice Christianity. This was a violent and traumatizing experience for the prisoners subjected to it. However, many did learn English and colonial cultural practices which led to the experiment being seen as a success by the American government. Pratt took his experiment to Congress and “requested funding for the similar education of all American Indians" <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf">[1]</a>. This boarding school model spread rapidly across the country and “by 1900 most American Indian children were being taken from their families”, severed from their culture and homeland, and forced to assimilate with American culture <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing.

                   <p>Land dispossession is accomplished by violent dispossession or treaty agreements. Violent dispossession is well understood by the general public, especially how it is a clear form of dispossession of land. However, treaties also dispossessed indigenous people of their land. Treaty agreements were not fair or equitable exchanges. Often Indigenous people were “coerced...into signing treaties” and forced into small reservations which made them reliant on the US government, due to the loss of their historical hunting and fishing grounds <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf">[1]</a>. Similarly, land was exchanged for the promise of education, which was in Indian Boarding Schools. This further reinforced the dual dispossession of indigenous people, dispossessing people of their land in exchange for dispossession of their culture. Treaties were often a bleak and destructive exchange.

        <h3>Dual Dispossession in Michigan: Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School and Michigan State University</h3>
    		     <p>This project focuses on the violence committed against the Anishinaabe Three Fires Confederacy, in present day Michigan. Michigan was not precluded from the spread of Indian Boarding Schools. One of the largest in the area was the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School which operated from 1893 to 1934. The school was created to fulfill part of the 1855 treaty with the Anishinabek. Many treaties included promises of formal education in return for indigenous lands, including much of the ancestral homelands of the Anishinaabe Three Fires Confederacy. However, this was not a positive exchange, Anishenabek people lost their land and indigenous children were sent to Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School which utilized Richard Pratt's model of cultural genocide. Anishinabek children were forcibly removed from their families and traumatized from the moment they arrived at the school. Children were “disinfected by having alcohol, kerosene, or DDT… poured on them” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf">[1]</a>. DDT is one of the most toxic pesticides known to man. All cultural and spiritual practices were cut off including cutting long hair, removal of personal belongings “such as medicine pouches, beadwork, family photographs, etc.” and removing traditional clothing and replacing them with uniforms <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf">[1]</a>. Children were also removed from their family heritage by being renamed with English first and last names. Children were forced to learn English and were taught their own culture and language was savage. Children were not allowed to maintain the spiritual practice or speak Anishiabemowin, the traditional language of the Anishenabek. The goal of the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding school was to take Anishenabek children and destroy all their connections to their culture and land. The American government believed that by severing indigenous children from their culture and land, they would no longer be able to carry on living as Anishenabek people and within a generation the Anishinaabe would cease to exist.

    Besides the land lost in the Treaty of 1855, the Anishenabek also lost a substantial portion of  land in the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw. Land ceded in the Treaty of Saginaw now holds the land grant university, Michigan State University. Michigan State University was founded in 1855, prior to the passing of the Morrill act, and served as a “model for [the] land grant system across the country” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Land-Grant Roots: MSUToday: Michigan State University. MSUToday. (2018, July 2). Retrieved April 10, 2022, from https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/land-grant-roots ">[2]</a>. The issue with land-grant universities is that the model takes lands unfairly ceeded to the national government, either by force or coercion, and turns them into capital. None of the accumulation of capital that comes from land grant universities, “would have been possible without the federal government initial accumulation and distribution of indigenous lands” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sharon Stein (2020) A colonial history of the higher education present: rethinking land-grant institutions through processes of accumulation and relations of conquest, Critical Studies in Education, 61:2, 212-228, DOI: 10.1080/17508487.2017.1409646">[3]</a>. The dispossession of Anishenabek land throughout the 19th century served to weaken indigenous power by cutting them off from their traditional hunting fishing grounds, burial grounds, and land they had stewarded for generations.

             All the actions that make up dual dispossession serve the higher goal of capital accumulation in some manner. Land dispossession is obvious, land that is taken by the U.S. government is capital they value. However, cultural dispossession and genocide that took place at the Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School was meant to sever Anishinaabe relations and take away their cultural and community power. The government wanted to limit the power of indigenous people to band together and fight back against the accumulation of their land. Land accumulation, especially in the form of land grant universities served as a form of capital accumulation for the state government.
              Capital grows in value and allows for funding of more capital accumulation. This means that land that was stolen and used for land grants, allowed for more land dispossession to occur. The founding of Michigan State University provided returns of 56 times its original value <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Lee, R., Ahtone, T., Pearce, M., Goodluck, K., McGhee, G., Leff, C., Lanpher, K., &amp; Salinas, T. (n.d.). Michigan State University . Landgrabu.org.https://www.landgrabu.org/universities/michigan-state-university ">[4]</a>. That accumulated value is used to fund other projects, all built of the back of land stolen from the Anishinaabe. Michigan State holds a special place in the grotesque land grant system because, in accumulating capital through the founding of Michigan State University, a model was created for the same violence to occur across the country. Michigan State is the model for how to extract capital and value from the dispossession of indigenous people.

          <h3> Looking Forward: Repatriation of Land and Culture </h3>
          <p> It is critical to name and analyze the history and ramifications of dual dispossession. However, that alone is not enough, a country build on the violent accumulation of capital at the expense of indigenous land and culture is not one we should feel comfortable living in. It is imperative we look to the future for how to atone for violence and begin to restore what was stolen and rebuild a community based in justice. Tackling the return of land is daunting but tangible. “Land Back” is a phrase used to mean many things but first and foremost it can mean exactly what it sounds like, returning land to the indigenous people who historically inhabited it. Vancouver repatriated a burial site in the city to the Musqueam First Nation, acknowledging that it holds cultural value and is rightfully theirs<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Britten, L. (2018, October 17). Vancouver returns city-owned land to Musqueam | CBC News. CBCnews.">[5]</a>. Even individual citizens have repatriated land to address the historic context that allowed them to own the land <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="CBC/Radio Canada. (2017, October 20). One woman's plan to give back: 'the land needs to be returned to indigenous peoples' | CBC radio. CBCnews.">[6]</a>. Land repatriation is a long and complicated project and includes rebuilding indigenous connection with the land <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Gamblin, R. (2019, November 4). Land back! what do we mean? 4Rs Youth Movement.https://4rsyouth.ca/land-back-what-do-we-mean/">[7]</a>. But dual dispossession is about more than loss of land, it is inextricably linked with loss of culture. Culture cannot so easily be returned.  What is stolen in a cultural genocide can't just be given back, its intangible. Stories, language, traditions and religious practice aren’t being stored by the federal government waiting to be returned, rebuilding culture is a complicated process. The Saginaw Chippewa  Indian Tribe has been committed to rebuilding lost cultural practices through educational programs, language immersion classes and a cultural center<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways. (n.d.). Ziibiwing- Home Page. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/">[8]</a> <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Anishinaabe Language Revitalization Department. Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan Homepage. (n.d.). http://www.sagchip.org/language/#.YmII1_PMLFo ">[9]</a>. The U.S. and Michigan government should provide resources to expand cultural rebuilding to begin an endeavor to “repatriate” stolen culture.
