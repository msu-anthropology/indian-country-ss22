        <h3>History of Disposession</h3>
		        <p>As American colonizers spread across the land known as the United States, they encountered the indigenous people who were already living there. Colonizers believed that it was their right and duty to expand across this landscape, a belief referred to as Manifest Destiny. Engagements between the two groups during this time were often incredibly violent, “strong military forces were frequently utilized against American Indians” and the United States government paid scalp bounties to encourage colonizers to kill American Indians (Ziibiwing 3)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ziibiwing Center (2011). American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf"></a>.  Indigenous people were “coerced...into signing treaties” and forced into small reservations which made them reliant on the US government, due to the loss of their historical hunting and fishing grounds (Ziibiwing 4)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ziibiwing Center (2011). American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf"></a>. During this time, white Americans had two differing ideas for how to resolve what they referred to as the “Indian problem”. Assimilationists believed that forcing indigenous people to live within the bounds of “mainstream white society including farming, Christianization, the English language, concepts such as democracy and private property, and eventually U S citizenship” would be the best way to keep indigenous people from hindering the expansion of colonial America (National Park Service)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="U.S. Department of the Interior.

Retrieved April 18, 2022, from https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-and-federal-indian-policy.htm"></a>. Their counterparts, exterminationists, believed indigenous people could not assimilate and that their cultural practices were uncivilized, thus violent extermination was necessary to continue to expand (National Park Service)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="U.S. Department of the Interior.

Retrieved April 18, 2022, from https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-and-federal-indian-policy.htm"></a>. President Ulysses S Grant was decisively assimilationist and began to implement policies federally to assimilate indigenous people to white culture. Grant also implemented a “peace policy” which dictated management of reservations to “various Christian dominations” (National Parks Service)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="U.S. Department of the Interior. (2021). President Ulysses S. Grant and federal Indian policy (U.S. National Park Service). National Parks Service. Retrieved April 18, 2022, from https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-and-federal-indian-policy.htm "></a>. Many political leaders supported assimilation over extermination because they found a cultural genocide to be more a more economically feasible way to commit genocide.Around this time, an army officer named Richard Pratt opened the first Indian boarding school. Pratt took indigenous prisoners of war, cut them off from their ancestral homeland by sending them to a boarding school where their hair was cut, they wore uniforms, and were forced to learn English and practice Christianity.

Gravemarker at Carlisle Indian Cemetery</a></figcaption>
              </figure>Pratt was the man who coined the ubiquitous phrase “kill the Indian, Save the man”. This was a violent and traumatizing experience for the prisoners subjected to it. However, many did learn English and colonial cultural practices which led to the experiment being seen as a success by the American government. Pratt took his experiment to Congress and “requested funding for the similar education of all American Indians” (Ziibiwing 5)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=""></a>. This boarding school model spread rapidly across the country and “by 1900 most American Indian children were being taken from their families”, severed from their culture and homeland, and forced to assimilate with American culture (Ziibiwing 5)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=""></a>. The US government used boarding schools to dispossess indigenous children of their culture and coercive treaties dispossessed indigenous tribes of their ancestral lands. This legacy of dual dispossession exists across the United States and can be used as a framework to understand the level of violence that indigenous people have faced.

        <h3>Cultural Dispossesssion: Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School</h3>
    		    <p>This project focuses on the violence committed against the Anishinaabe Three Fires Confederacy, in present day Michigan. Michigan was not precluded from the spread of Indian Boarding Schools. One of the largest in the area was the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School which operated from 1893 to 1934. The school was created to fulfill part of the 1855 treaty with the Anishinabek. Many treaties included promises of formal education in return for indigenous lands, including much of the ancestral homeland of the Anishenabe Three Fires Confederacy. However, this was not a positive exchange, Anishenabek people lost their land and indigenous children were sent to Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School which utilized Richard Pratt's model of cultural genocide. Anishinabek children were forcibly removed from their families and traumatized from the moment they arrived at the school. Children were “disinfected by having alcohol, kerosene, or DDT… poured on them” (Ziibiwing 10)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ziibiwing Center (2011). American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic & Cultural Cleansing. Ziibiwing Center. http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/AIBSCurrGuide.pdf"></a>. DDT is one of the most toxic pesticides known to man. All cultural and spiritual practices were cut off including cutting long hair, removal of personal belongings “such as medicine pouches, beadwork, family photographs, etc.” and removing traditional clothing and replacing them with uniforms (Ziibiwing 10)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Ziibiwing Center (2011).

After Attending An Indian Industrial Boarding School</a></figcaption>Children were also removed from their family heritage by being renamed with English first and last names. Children were forced to learn English and were taught their own culture and language was savage. Children were not allowed to maintain the spiritual practice or speak Anishiabemowin, the traditional language of the Anishenabek. The goal of the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding school was to take Anishenabek children and destroy all their connections to their culture and land. The American government believed that by severing indigenous children from their culture and land, they would no longer be able to carry on living as Anishenabek people and within a generation the Anishinabe would cease to exist.

        <h3>Land Disposession: Michigan State University and the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw</h3>
    		     <p>Besides the land lost in the Treaty of 1855, the Anishenabek also lost a substantial portion of  land in the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw. Land ceded in the Treaty of Saginaw now holds land grant university, Michigan State University. Michigan State University was founded in 1855, prior to the passing of the Morrill act, and served as a “model for [the] land grant system across the country” (MSU)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Land-Grant Roots: MSUToday: Michigan State University. MSUToday. (2018, July 2). Retrieved April 10, 2022, from https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/land-grant-roots "></a>. <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-top:5px; float:left; width: 40%">

               </figure> The issue with land-grant universities is that the model takes lands unfairly ceeded to the national government, either by force or coercion, and turns them into capital. None of the accumulation of capital that comes from land grant universities, “would have been possible without the federal government initial accumulation and distribution of indigenous lands” (Stein)<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sharon Stein (2020) A colonial history of the higher education present: rethinking land-grant institutions through processes of accumulation and relations of conquest, Critical Studies in Education, 61:2, 212-228, DOI: 10.1080/17508487.2017.1409646"></a>. The dispossession of Anishenabek land throughout the 19th century served to weaken indigenous power by cutting them off from their traditional hunting fishing grounds, burial grounds, and land they had stewarded for generations. It also served as a form of capital accumulation for the state government, and in accumulating capital through the founding of Michigan State University on stolen land, a model was created for the same violence to occur across the country and capital was created to expand the economy on the backs of Anishenabek people who were dispossessed from their land.

        <h3>Impacts of Dual Disposession</h3>
     		     <p>This leads to the impact of cultural and land dispossession. These two experiences of the Anishenabek do not exist separate from another, instead they are intertwined and compounding, designed with the express purpose to eliminate indigenous communities for the benefit of the American Government. The “Indian problem” that the US government ran into was actually a want to expand capital accumulation and spread colonial ideology across North America and indigenous people powerfully resisting their goals. Taking culture and land from indigenous people was an attempt to subvert their power and has led to lasting damage. Treaties coerced indigenous people into giving up their land in exchange for having their children severed from their culture. Land is incredibly important too cultural practice and to both remove people from their land and their culture simultaneously causes compounding damage and separation from families and culture. </p>
