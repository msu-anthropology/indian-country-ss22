  <h3><strong>Early History of the Odawa and the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians</strong></h3>
		      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		        <p>The Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians (LTBB) is a tribe belonging to the group of Odawa Indians which has historically served as one of three groups that form the Anishinaabeg along with the Ojibwe and the Potawatomi. The Odawa, derived from the Anishinaabe word for trade, historically occupied a large spanse of land surrounding the Great Lakes until the intervention of French and European traders, and eventually colonizers. Odawa oral histories hold much variation on whether they migrated to the Michilimackinac or whether the Odawa people originated there. Western archaeological findings provide some evidence that the Anishinaabe migrated west from the east coast, and divided into three groups somewhere near modern day Detroit. Archaeological evidence on Manitoulin Island supports that ancestors of the Odawa may have first migrated to the Great Lakes area thousands of years ago. The group historically referred to themselves mainly as Anishinaabe, meaning “people” during early historical interactions. By the mid 1650s, French missionaries and traders were using the North Channel as a route inland. These Europeans spread rampant disease to the Odawa occupying the area, at the same time that the Five Nations of the Iroqouis had begun raiding the area in endeavors to control the blooming French fur trade. In the midst of these two forces, a vast amount of the early Odawa people were either killed, or driven to other areas of the Great Lakes. The Odawa settled in many areas around the lakes, with the LTBB settling mainly in the point between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. The Odawa and many other tribes in the Great Lakes area were referred to in records at this point by their trading names, including Odawa, Sioux, Winnebago, and many others.

<h3><b> Michilimackinac </b></h3>
  <hr>
    <p>One such area that possible ancestors of the LTBB migrated, was the area and island which they called Michilimackinac. This area provided a strategic location for the Anishinaabeg to control Great Lakes trade beginning in the 1600s, and became the main center for northern fur trade between the allied Anishinaabeg and the French. In 1715, the French established Fort Michilimackinac as a major trading post. The Fort fell to British control in 1715 during the Seven Years War, to Ojibwe control in 1763 during Pontiac’s War, and again to British control in 1764. The Fort remained in British control until the Revolutionary War when the fort was abandoned as the British moved their center of control to Fort Mackinac on Mitchimakinak, or Mackinac Island. Mitchimakinak was originally inhabited by the Menominee, Ojibwe, and Odawa peoples.</p>
<h3> <b> Post European-Colonial History</b> </h3>
<hr>
  <br>
    <p>Following the Revolutionary War, a series of treaties including the 1807 Treaty of Detroit ceded nearly all land in the northeast of North America from the Odawa and other tribes to the United States government. Following the War of 1812 and the Indian Removal Act of 1830, nearly all Odawa people were forcibly removed to modern day Kansas. For the Odawa and other natives occupying the northwest Great Lakes area, the War of 1812 brought conflict in the form of two major battles between American forces and the British fort on Mackinac, in which Odawa and Ojibwe indigenous peoples had sided with the British to oppose American colonial rule. The loss of these battles led to American control of the island. Through a series of early treaties, the Menominee people were removed to some of their original lands in Wisconsin. The Odawa, however, were spared removal in large part due to the efforts of Agatha Biddle, a mixed French, Ottawa, and Ojibwe woman living on Mackinac island in the 1800s. Biddle was influential in negotiating that the Anishinaabeg peoples not be moved west out of their territory as part of the Indian Removal Act. She argued that many of her people were too influential in the Michigan economy at the time to be moved out of the region. The Anishinaabeg were ultimately allowed to remain thanks to Biddle and many others who helped to negotiate the 1855 Treaty of Detroit.

<br>
    <p>In 1863, the Treaty of Washington was signed in which the Odawa and Chippewa tribes ceded ~16 million acres of land to the US government, in return for allowing the tribes to stay on small reservations on their lands with access to resources. In turn, these native groups retained the right to continue their own practices of living off the land. Historically, these rights have not been well respected either socially or legally. Federal organizations and private businesses alike have outwardly claimed to respect these boundaries and put forth a face of cooperation, but have had a historical tendency to skirt around these guidelines. These treaties are often ignored in any case where obliging them would interfere with the plans and aspirations of these businesses and organizations, as with situations such as the Line 5 pipeline. In this situation it has come to light that one of these businesses, Enbridge, while complying with obligations to assess areas of operation for cultural significance, blatantly failed to specify anything linked to indigenous heritage as culturally significant, leading to false approval of the sites for construction in that regard.

    <p>The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians currently occupies established lands covering much of Charlevoix and Emmet counties in Northern Michigan, mainly populating the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation. The Michilmackinac area, and Mackinac Island specifically, draw in thousands of tourists every summer to the historical landmarks, including the Biddle House which is the oldest standing house on Mackinac Island today, and, through collaborative efforts between the Mackinac Parks Department and the LTBB, now documents Agatha Biddles efforts in negotiation for the Anishinaabeg. A recent addition to the island, resulting from another collaboration between the LTBB and the staff of the Mackinac State Parks Department, is the Native American Cultural History Trail. A trail along the perimeter of the island which features six stations documenting the cultural history of the original inhabitants of the island, the Anishinaabeg. This trail documents the island’s history as the center of the Anishinaabeg world. The signs highlight the ceremonies the Anishinaabeg performed on the island to celebrate the changing of the seasons, celebrations of the spirits existing there, and to bury and celebrate their dead. Many of the Anishinaabeg communities just to the North and South of the Island, including the LTBB, engage in some of these traditions today. Despite these contributions and continued efforts, the area’s tourism centers almost exclusively on old American and British colonial history. Collaboration with indigenous groups in  Michilimackinac continues work towards documentation and enhancing positive exposure to the indigenous history of the area.

    <h3><b>Conclusion and Repatriation Efforts</b></h3>
    <hr>
      <p>	The Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians has a long history and sacred history in the Mackinaw area, in which they continue to work towards reclaimation of their heritage and sharing of their cultural practices. In recent years tribe members have been working closely with the Mackinac State Parks to shift the narrative that has been painted by colonizers. Their work with the state parks has been reflected in the equal participation on many recent projects including the Biddle House, as well as museums around Michilimackinac, like the Ojibwe Museum. On these important projects tribe members have spearheaded to design, selection, and presentation of material to show the story of the LTBB and other indigenous groups from their perspective. This is important progress towards the reclaimation of indigenous history and the proactive cooperation of the state parks and museums involved should not be understated. In addition, shifting ideas about tourism and the history of America is also helpful to understanding the needs of native populations all over the country. When visiting new places it is important to always have an open mind and listen to the communities who you are touring. There are many sides and many truths to any story, and it is important to open your eyes and ears to all of them. The LTBB has been living in the Mackinac area much further back than colonial history reaches and the cultural significance of Mackinac Island should be recognized. Michilmackinac, and the island especially, are sacred places that must be treated with the utmost respect. The indigenous perspective has been missing from the Michilmackinac narrative for far too long, and the active listening of tourists to the area is imperative to the goal of reinstating it.
