        <p> Ezra Cornell was born January 11, 1807 in Westchester Landing, currently the Bronx, NY. Cornell began his career as a carpenter and then finally as a mechanic at a cotton mill on Cascadilla Creek. He married his wife, Mary Ann Wood, in 1831. Upon the growth of his family, Cornell began work on sales for a new type of plow he had purchased patent rights for.  Over the years and throughout multiple inventions, Cornell began working with Samuel F.B. Morse and supervised the erection of multiple telegraph lines, leading to his promotion to president of the company in 1849. Upon the creation of Western Union company (through the consolidation of companies), Cornell received $2 million in Western Union stock.<a href="#Bibliography">[2]</a></p>
        <p>In 1864 Cornell's second-quarter stock payment from Western Union was $35,000 which would be roughly $700,000 today. Cornell wrote, “My greatest care now is how to spend this large income to do the greatest good to those who are properly dependent on me, to the poor and to posterity.” Eventually, he would donate a substantial portion of his wealth to found Cornell University.<a href="#Bibliography">[4]</a></p>
        <p> The land grant that catalyzed the formation of Cornell was nothing more than a gift of the economic value of federal public lands by the federal government to the state governments. Land was simply the currency of the gift. The federal government could have made an outright grant of cash or even the mineral rights to the land. Had the latter occurred, Cornell and other land-grant institutions might have been called the “mineral-grant” colleges.<a href="#Bibliography">[8]</a> </p>

        <h3>The Morrill Act of 1862</h3>
        <br>
		        <p>The land grant was set in motion by Justin Smith Morrill, who was a United States representative from Vermont, in 1857. Morrill submitted a bill in the effort to elevate higher education in the states, specifically for “the endowment, support and maintenance of at least one college in each state where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific or classical studies, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, as the legislatures of the states may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.” Although the bill faced opposition, it was eventually passed and vetoed by President Buchanan. Buchanan believed the bill unconstitutional and too expensive. </p><a href="#Bibliography">[8]</a>
            <p> Abraham Lincoln became president in 1861, and the bill was signed into law on July 2, 1862. The act had provisions:
              <ul>
                <li>1)	Each state was to receive 30,000 acres of public land within its boundaries for each of its congressional senators and representatives.</li>
                <li>2)	The land could be located, claimed, and sold for cash, which was then to be invested to create a permanent endowment to support higher education. If the state had no public land or if it had an insufficient amount, it would be given an equivalent amount of land scrip. The scrip could be sold on the open market to realize the value of the land.</li>
                <figure style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; float: left; width: 30%">
                  <img src="img/land-scrip.jpg" width="100%">
                  <figcaption><a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/e/9340/files/2020/09/Image2ScripPiece1189.jpg" target="_blank">Image 4. New York's Land Scrip July 2, 1862</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <li>3)	All management and investment expense had to be borne by the state, and not from the proceeds of the land sale. The endowment created had to be invested at a rate of not less than 5 percent, and the state had to make up any investment shortfall and replace and lost principal.</li>
                <li>4)	Proceeds from the endowment, which could not be used for “the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building or buildings,” had to be made available for: … the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in several pursuits and professions of life.</li>
                <li>5)	Each state and territory had two years to accept these conditions and five years to complete its sale and fund at least one college in the state with this mission.<a href="#Bibliography">[8]</a></li></ul>
                <p> The Morrill Act allocated and sold 17.4 million acres of land which yielded a $7.55 million endowment. All together the federal government gave away near 1.14 billion acres of "public land" during this period, which is roughly the size of Denmark. New York received the largest amount of the grant, close to 990,000 acres in the form of scrip. <a href="#Bibliography">[9]</a></p>

                <h3> The Inception of Cornell University </h3>
                <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; float: right; width: 50%">
                  <img src="img/endowment.jpg" width="100%">
                  <figcaption><a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/e/9340/files/2020/07/Cornell-Land-Grant-Map_v2.4-100-768x370.jpg" target="_blank">Image 5. Whose endowment raised the most from Indigenous land?</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> Being the most populous state of the time, New York received nearly ten percent of the land allotted by the Morrill Act. Out of the 10,929,215 acres allotted, New York received 989,920. Eastern states such as New York had no available public lands to claim, and as such received land scrips. As states were barred from taking direct ownership of land in another state, eastern states would sell their scrip to individuals and then invest the proceeds in stocks and bonds which would yield a minimum of five percent annually a year. The revenues from these stocks and bonds would serve as endowment support for at least one college that offered instruction in agriculture and mechanic arts.<a href="#Bibliography">[9]</a> </p>
                  <p>New York accepted the grant provided by the Morrill Act on March 4, 1863 and on May 5, 1863 the State Legislature authorized the Comptroller to receive 6,187 pieces of land scrip totalling 989,920 acres.
                  Cornell wrote, “Being unwilling to allow this scrip to be sold at the price it would command in the market [approx.. $.50/acre in 1865], I decided to purchase the scrip and locate that lands with my own means and at my own risk for the benefit of the University.”<a href="#Bibliography">[9]</a> Cornell scouted the former land of the Ojibwe within Wisconsin, and it was estimated that the amount of land that actual settlers located and entered with these scrips would eventually obtain higher prices once the more desirable government land had already been sold. The land was located in 6,716 parcels across 15 current states and 202 counties, and by 1914 an estimated $5.7 million had been raised from these lands for the University (this is approximately $148 million in 2020 dollars).<a href="#Bibliography">[9]</a> As of 1914, Cornell had raised over 4.5 times as much money as the next closest land-grant university (Montana State). In return, the Ojibwe were forced into a number of reservations throughout Wisconsin, where the federal government forced them to assimilate to American culture. Children were sent away to boarding schools and banned from speaking the Ojibwe language, practicing their religion or engaging in their own culture.
                  <a href="#Bibliography">[6]</a>  </p>
                  <p> Ezra Cornell used his own funds from previous ventures to purchase the scrips in his own name. He agreed to sell the lands he purchased within 25 years and to put the funds toward the University.  Anything above and beyond $.60 an acre was to be put into what was called the Cornell Endowment Fund, to be used in perpituity by the University. The final contract was signed August 4, 1866 and put Cornell on the map. The first building was named Morrill Hall after Justin Morrill himself, and thus began a long line of generational wealth created by the sale of stolen land.<a href="#Bibliography">[9]</a> </p>

                  </figure><p> The main victims of Morrill’s act were those of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’, also known as the Cayuga Nation. A part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy since the 12th century, traditionally nestled in northern New York, the nation shares ties with the Onondaga, Mohawk, Oneida, and Seneca Nations, respectively.</p>
                  <p> However, starting in the 18th century, these nations faced eager, violent, and fatal means of colonialism. In 1779 the U.S government targeted the Cayuga Nation. Villages and key orchards were destroyed, with a large majority of its people dying from starvation and exposure. 1794 saw the signing of a treaty between the Confederacy and the federal government maintaining that the Cayuga people had the rights to 64,000 acres of land. Ultimately, this land was never given to them and they were forced to buy lawful pieces of their own territory back far into the future.
                    <a href="#Bibliography">[1]</a></p>
                  <p> New York State still will not recognize Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫʼ sovereignty. Because of NYS and BIA’s refusals to recognize Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫʼ as a sovereign people, they continue to meet resistance in their struggle to exist and thrive.</p>
                  <p> Land-grant Universities, from the outset, were designed to “meet the needs of the sons and daughters of toil,” the children of working-class families who were not able to afford to attain a college degree otherwise. Although it has been said that they offered educational opportunities “for the rest of us”, until recently it has been overlooked that the profit and opportunities were created from the seizure of Indigenous lands.  Genesis amnesia was created by sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron to draw attention to "processes by which societies cover up or erase the origins of policies or institutions in order to obfuscate the social constructions that underlie them". Geneis amnesia was what allowed people to believe that colleges like Cornell had no meaningful connection to the severance of indigenous land, and it is genesis amnesia that allows us to believe that “democracy's colleges” were founded primarily to increase access to higher education. Their existence fully depended on the forced removal of Indigenous peoples, the expropriation of Native land, and the erasure of that history. Educational institutions benefited and, as a result, higher education was more easily available and more affordable to more people than ever before. But the founding of the land-grant institutions came at a great cost.

                  <h3> Reparations </h3>

                  <p> As a way to shed light on the university’s grisly past, the formation of the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program (AIISP) was founded and later given status as its own department. Now, a land acknowledgment is read prior to all events that take place that are university-related. </p>
                  <p> The Land Acknowledgment states: </p>
                  <p>  "Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the
                    Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of
                    the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations
                    with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The
                    Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New
                    York State, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the
                    painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing
                    connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands
                    and waters." Detailed information on the Land Acknowledgement can be found
                     <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/american-indian-indigenous-studies/about/land-acknowledgment" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                  <p>Additionally, steps are being taken to return lands not being used for educational purposes to the Cayuga Nation and a mandatory Indigenous studies class is being taught to all first-year students at Cornell.<a href="#Bibliography">[3]</a></p>
                  <p> Finally, Cornell has created a new housing hall named after the Ganędagǫ:. Ganędagǫ: Hall is named in the language of the Gayogo̱ hó꞉nǫ’, the name for the Cayuga Nation in their own language. Ganędagǫ: means “it's in the hill,” which was the ancestral name for the land upon which Cornell is built. </p>
                  <p>  A video on Cornell's Gayogo̱ hó꞉nǫ’ language class can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3QQvR2vcXY " rel="citation" data-toggle="popver" data-content="Youtube video on Cornell's language class"">here. </a>  </p>
                  <p> Other ideas for reparations are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Curriculum reform that includes the mandatory teaching of this history</li>
                      <li>Budget reallocation to aid Indigenous students and faculty</li>
                      <li>Establishment of satellite campuses on reservations</li>
                      <li>Buyback programs to purchase and return land to tribal nations</li>
