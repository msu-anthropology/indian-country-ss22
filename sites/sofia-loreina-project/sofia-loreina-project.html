      <h1>NATIVE VISIBILITY AND RESOURCES AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY</h1>
      <h4><em> Sofia Rabiela </em></h4>
          <hr>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

		        <p>Michigan State University, known as the “Pioneer Land Grant College,” is one of many universities that has gained land from the Morrill Act of 1862. This act was set in place to “donate” public land to universities so areas of studies such as agriculture could be expanded. In a self-reflective manner, Michigan State University does acknowledge that the land grant was implemented with the dismissal of the Anishinaabeg - The Fires Confederacy of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi peoples. Even with the implemented Treaty of 1819, as referenced in the MSU Land Acknowledgement, it is most likely that these native peoples were coerced into an agreement that benefitted federal economy, universities, and non indigenous peoples. This particular study will be focusing on the recognition and resources that have been given to Indigenous Students and communities within the University as well as change that is on the rise.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>UNIVERSITY RECOGNITION</h3>

          <h4>LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h4>
            <p>Land acknowledgements are formal statements that are given in a multitude of settings such as emails, formal events, celebrations, performances, sporting events etc. These statements are given to shed light on the indigenous lands that the university occupies and that although there are treaties in place, pain and suffering were inflicted and continually inflicted upon these peoples. These acknowledgments also serve as a reminder that these people and tribes still exist in the state of Michigan and we should be aware of the policies set in place by the university that affect indigenous students and communities while simultaneously striving to improve them.</p>
