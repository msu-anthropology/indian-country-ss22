      <p>The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline is a work of fossil fuel infrastructure that has become increasingly contentious as protests by Indigenous ‘water protectors’ have brought Michigan’s attention to the potential for a pipeline rupture in the Great Lakes. At the core of this issue is the theft, and subsequent pollution, of Indigenous land.</p>

              Enbridge is one of the largest oil and gas transportation companies in North America, responsible for the construction and maintenance of ten active natural gas pipelines in the United States <a href="https://www.enbridge.com/about-us/natural-gas-transmission-and-midstream" target="blank">[3]</a>. The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline was constructed in 1953 as part of the company’s Lakehead System, which starts in Superior, Wisconsin, and ends in Sarnia, Canada; the over 645-mile long pipeline transports approximately 22.68 million gallons of crude oil a day
              <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/line5/0,9833,7-413-99504---,00.html" target="blank">[1]</a>. In Michigan, Line 5 runs over 400 rivers and streams, wetlands, and through the Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron - two Great Lakes <a href="https://www.cleanwateraction.org/features/line-5-history#:~:text=The%20pipeline%20was%20constructed%20in,over%20400%20rivers%20and%20streams" target="blank">[2]</a>.</p>

            <p>Widespread concern over Line 5 began in 2010, when an Enbridge line near Marshall, MI spilled approximately 1 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River. This inland spill, one of the largest in U.S. history, brought mainstream attention to Enbridge’s environmental impact and the potential damage Line 5 could cause to the Great Lakes <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/line5/0,9833,7-413-99504---,00.html" target="blank">[1]</a>. Line 5 was originally meant to operate for 50 years, meaning that the line should have been decommissioned in 2003. When 2003 passed with no dismantling of the pipeline, protests and concerns accelerated <a href="https://www.cleanwateraction.org/features/line-5-history#:~:text=The%20pipeline%20was%20constructed%20in,over%20400%20rivers%20and%20streams" target="blank">[2]</a>.</p>

              Enbridge’s pipelines have historically opposed and harmed Indigenous communities, who have been the biggest voice in support of shutting down Line 5. In Michigan, the Anishinaabe community possessed an easement that allowed Enbridge to operate Line 5 on their land. This easement expired in 2011, but Line 5 continues to operate on the Straits of Mackinac to this day <a href="https://www.irreview.org/articles/2021/12/5/the-fate-of-enbridges-line-5-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-anishinaabe-people-of-bay-mills" target="blank">[15]</a>. The continued operation of this pipeline and the conflict surrounding it represent the political and environmental implications of the theft of Indigenous land in Michigan.</p>

          <p>The Great Lakes are culturally and economically significant to the Anishinabek people, which refers to a group of culturally and linguistically related First Nations that live both in Canada and the United States, concentrated around the Great Lakes. The Indigenous group that is most commonly referred to as Anishinaabe are the Ojibwe people, but the term also includes Chippewa, Odawa, and Potawatomi people. First Nations is a term used to describe Indigenous peoples in Canada who are not Metis or Inuit. First Nations people are original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada, and were the first to encounter sustained European contact, settlement, and trade <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anishinaabe" target="blank">[12]</a>.</p>
          <p> Line 5 runs through the Straits of Mackinac, connected to the Great Lakes. Mackinac Island holds significant meaning for the Anishinaabe. Ceremonies were held on the island to celebrate the changing seasons and used as a way for the community to pay their respects to the spirits who dwell in the area and control the lakes, ensuring that there were many fish and that travelers could make it across the lake safely <a href="https://www.spiritualtravels.info/spiritual-sites-around-the-world/north-america/spiritual-traditions-of-mackinac-island/" target="blank">[5]</a>.

              A Line 5 rupture would destroy the health of the environment and its people by polluting the waters and disrupting the ecosystems providing surrounding communities with resources like water and fish; the people who live in the Great Lakes region would be put at great risk <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/northern-michigan-tribes-protesting-line-5-hunker-down-winter" target="blank">[14]</a>.</p>
          <p>James Pitawanakwat and his wife, Christina Keshik of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, own the wooded properties in Levering and Cross Village, Michigan that have become the temporary home for protestors of Line 5. Stakeholders and ‘water protectors’ have come together in that area, dubbed Camp Anishinaabek, to protest Enbridge and advocate for a Line 5 shutdown <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/northern-michigan-tribes-protesting-line-5-hunker-down-winter" target="blank">[14]</a>.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised against Enbridge and the state of Michigan about potential treaty rights violations and some environmental groups have even raised legal questions regarding public trust laws in relation to a proposed Line 5 tunnel <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-tribes-say-line-5-pipeline-tunnel-plan-ignores-treaty-rights" target=blank>[6]</a>. After the Kalamazoo River oil spill, Enbridge should have expected uneasiness and protest. Instead, Enbridge continues to maintain and expand Line 5 without waiting for state permission or consulting relevant stakeholders and Indigenous groups <a href="https://www.irreview.org/articles/2021/12/5/the-fate-of-enbridges-line-5-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-anishinaabe-people-of-bay-mills" target=blank>[15]</a>.
            The risk of a devastating oil spill in the Great Lakes, resulting from a rupture in the pipeline, threatens the Treaty of 1836, which “reserved for all time the right to fish, hunt, and gather in the ceded land and waters in the State of Michigan - including the ceded waters of Lake Superior, Huron, and Michigan, which includes the Straits of Mackinac” <a href="https://www.irreview.org/articles/2021/12/5/the-fate-of-enbridges-line-5-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-anishinaabe-people-of-bay-mills" target=blank>[15]</a>.</p>

          <p>The Treaty of 1836 was forged between the United States Government and the Indigenous peoples of North America. Almost 16 million acres of land in the North and South peninsulas of Michigan were ceded to the United States. Sections of land were picked out to be used as Reservations for the Tribes, under which hunting, fishing, gathering, money stipends, and other things were supposed to be secured rights. The Tribes’ perspective is that the building of Line 5 on the ceded land of the Reservation is violating the treaty because the risk of a pipeline rupture threatens the people who live in the area <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/leaving-our-native-country-forever.htm#:~:text=The%20Treaty%20of%201836%20ceded,important%20stipulations%20of%20the%20treaty" target=blank>[13]</a>.</p>

          <p>The State has previously attempted to challenge the tribes’ right to hunt and fish on the ceded territory, and the Federal government sued on behalf of the tribes. Since 1985, the tribes and State have partnered to manage and protect the upper Great Lakes, and Line 5 threatens both that partnership and treaty rights <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-tribes-say-line-5-pipeline-tunnel-plan-ignores-treaty-rights" target=blank>[6]</a>. Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been attempting to shut down Line 5 for over a year, fighting against Enbridge lobbyists and Republican officials. Governor Whitmer campaigned on promises to shut down Line 5, but despite her recent efforts, there hasn’t been much progress. Whitmer gave Enbridge a deadline to shut down Line 5 and revoke its easement rights effective May 12, 2021. However, Enbridge insisted that they are “not subject to state regulators and rather the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration” <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/05/michigan-gov-whitmer-doesnt-back-down-from-fight-to-force-enbridge-line-5-shutdown.html" target=blank>[10]</a>.</p>

  <h3>Environmental Implications</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
           <p> Local Anishinaabe communities have opposed the continued operation of Enbridge’s Line 5 since the 2011 expiration of the land easement that allowed Enbridge to operate on Anishinaabe land <a href="https://www.irreview.org/articles/2021/12/5/the-fate-of-enbridges-line-5-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-anishinaabe-people-of-bay-mills" target="blank">[15]</a>. Demands to shut the pipeline down have been focused on the infrastructure’s age and the risk it poses to Great Lakes resources, aquatic and shoreline environments, and fishing communities <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Brosemer, Kathleen, Chelsea Schelly, Valoree Gagnon, Kristin L.

             Line 5, with its associated risk of oil spills and fossil fuel pollution, poses a direct risk to the environmental sustainability, habitat viability, and ecosystem services of the Great Lakes.</p>
           <p>The largest threat Line 5 poses to the environment is that of an oil spill. Indigenous protests and water protectors highlight this threat in the ‘Water is Sacred’ movement that has emerged to raise awareness of the risk Line 5 poses to the waters of the Great Lakes <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/northern-michigan-tribes-protesting-line-5-hunker-down-winter" target="blank">[14]</a>. Multiple worst-case Line 5 scenarios were modeled in a 2018 risk analysis study by Michigan Technological University. This risk analysis evaluated different types of pipeline failure, including pinhole leaks, full-bore ruptures, and a tier 5 rupture; it found that no matter the type of failure, a pipeline spill occurring in the winter season between December and February would be incredibly difficult to respond to safely or effectively. Line 5, a pipeline well past its prime, is increasingly at risk of failure-causing conditions - like corrosion, defects, fatigue, and over-pressurization - during the winter season when the Great Lakes ice over

'The perceived risk of the Line 5 Pipeline and spills under ice.’ Journal of Great Lakes Research 47, no. 1 (2021): 226-235.">[7]</a>. The greatest risk of irreversible oil pollution, therefore, is also the most probable one. This highlights the environmental danger of Line 5’s operation.

           </p>
           <p>Enbridge, by continuing the operation of this pipeline, is endangering the diverse and crucial ecosystems present in the Great Lakes in direct opposition to the Indigenous stakeholders that rely on the economic and cultural ecosystem services of these freshwater resources. The theft and pollution of Indigenous land actively interrupt tribal environmental stewardship efforts. Anishinaabe's way of life relies on Great Lakes resources like wild rice and Walleye fish, which are threatened by the environmental risks of Line 5. The ecological relationship between the Anishinaabe people and these natural resources is one that ensures longevity, environmental health, and sustainability <a href="https://www.narf.org/cases/enbridges-line-5-pipeline/" target="blank">[11]</a>. The environmental implications of Line 5’s continued operation, therefore, include the degradation of stakeholder relationships, decreased efficacy of environmental stewardship, and the irreplaceable loss of culturally significant resources.</p>

   <h3>Line 5 Today</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Despite two federal lawsuits to halt crude oil transportation through the pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 5 is still in operation in 2022 <a href="https://www.irreview.org/articles/2021/12/5/the-fate-of-enbridges-line-5-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-anishinaabe-people-of-bay-mills" target="blank">[15]</a>. The company’s projects are, in fact, expanding: as of February 2022, Enbridge is set to seek contractors for a new tunnel through the Straits of Mackinac that would house the underwater portion of Line 5 <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/02/enbridge-can-seek-line-5-tunnel-construction-bids-michigan-panel-says.html" target="blank">[16]</a>. This is in light of increasing efforts to shut down the pipeline under Governor Whitmer’s authority. Enbridge has warned against the shutdown of Line 5 by arguing that Upper Peninsula residents would be stranded without propane, regional refineries would fail, and energy prices for consumers would skyrocket. However, these have proven to be dramatic exaggerations in favor of an already expensive and high-risk pipeline. New studies have shown that there are alternatives to Line 5; other pipelines with less environmentally catastrophic ‘worst-case scenarios’, like Line 78, can be used to transport oil between the U.S. and Canada with little to no change in energy prices for consumers
           <a href="https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2022/02/new-report-enbridge-line-5-closure-michigan/" target="blank">[17]</a>
           . There has also been a proposed relocation of Line 5 from the Straits of Mackinac to Ashland, Bayfield, and Iron County, Wisconsin. Enbridge would have to acquire all the proper permits and forms before relocation building could begin  <a href="https://www.stopline3.org/line5" target="blank">[4]</a>.

         <br>
         <p>Unfortunately, the contemporary conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting uptick in gas prices in the U.S. has changed the current conversations around a potential Line 5 shutdown. In early March of 2022, the Michigan Legislature approved a resolution supporting energy independence and discouraging Governor Whitmer’s plan to shut down Line 5. The lawmakers backing this move argue that domestic oil production should be prioritized at this time, while environmentalists argue that U.S. priorities should lie with expanding the capacity of renewable fuels <a href="https://www.wxpr.org/michigan-news/2022-03-11/mi-groups-back-shutting-down-line-5-despite-legislative-moves" target="blank">[8]</a>. The Indigenous Environmental Network and other climate activism groups have called on President Joe Biden to invoke the Defense Protection Act, which would accelerate the transition to renewable energy and hasten the phasing out of fossil fuels from global industries

           Efforts to shut down Line 5 permanently persist to this day.</p>
