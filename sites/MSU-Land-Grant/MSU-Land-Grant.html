      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>The Michigan State University campus is the first land grant university. This is something that the MSU community takes pride in and the moniker is associated with various programs, such as the Land Grant Goods project. In this website we aim to both explore the heritage of the MSU’s being the first land grant university and shine light on the Indigeous Ojibwe community that was sacrificed to fulfill this goal.</p>

            <p>When walking on to Michigan State University’s campus, from either the East or West entrances, you can see the big university signs with the institution's name carved in the stone underneath it are the words “The Pioneer Land-Grant University”. This is the university’s way of showing that it is the school that the Morrill Act based its funded schools off of in 1862.

  <br>
      Michigan State University, once known as The Agricultural College of Michigan, was founded in 1855. The Agricultural College of Michigan was founded to provide higher education to all citizens, regardless of social class <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Land-Grant Roots: Msutoday: Michigan State University.” MSUToday, Michigan State University, 2 July 2018, msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/land-grant-roots.">(Land-Grant, 2018).</a> Today, Michigan State University is in the top 100 universities in the world and has helped produce many high achieving scientists, leaders, and scholars (History). MSU was one of the colleges that the Morrill Act was based on and funded. The Morrill Act was signed in 1862 and funded colleges similar to MSU. The land set aside for these schools helped to fund one school in each state that would focus on combining “liberal and practical” education with the industrial classes to provide education on agriculture, mechanical arts, and military tactics <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history."> (History).</a> The Morrill Act is what started the land-grant universities.
  <br>

  <br>
      The Morrill Act set aside federal land in the West for each state to use and profit off of in order to fund higher education institutions for all social classes. Most states, like Michigan, sold the land that they were given through the Morrill Act and used the money to start a college that followed the outlined requirements of the 1862 Act <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bao, Robert. “Cover Story: What It Means to Be a Land-Grant University.” Alumni, Michigan State University, 22 Dec. 2014, alumni.msu.edu/stay-informed/alumni-stories/cover-story-what-it-means-to-be-a-land-grant-university.">(Bao, 2014).</a> The universities funded by the Morrill Act were required to provide education in agriculture and mechanical arts in order to promote liberal and practical education for the industrial classes in the United States <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bao, Robert. “Cover Story: What It Means to Be a Land-Grant University.” Alumni, Michigan State University, 22 Dec. 2014, alumni.msu.edu/stay-informed/alumni-stories/cover-story-what-it-means-to-be-a-land-grant-university.">(Bao, 2014).</a> Today, there are more than 100 land-grant universities that can be traced back to the Morrill Act and its funding.
  <br>
  <br>
      Not all the history of the Morrill Act and the land-grant universities is positive. The land-grant universities benefited from the seizure and dispossession of land from Native Americans, which played a large role in the westward expansion <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a> Much of the land that is now owned or was owned by the land-grant universities was ceded in treaties, most of which were through coercion and violence against the Indigenous peoples. MSU’s main campus sits on land that is considered to be traditional, ancestral, and contemporary lands of the Anishinabek people, this was acquired through the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw when the land was given up by the Indigenous peoples that once occupied it <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a> The Land granted to benefit MSU through the Morrill Act was ceded from the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan in the 1819 treaty, as well as two other treaties from 1836. There is more land that the university owns and operates on that was ceded in treaties between the late 1700s and early 1840s <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a>

          <h3>The History Behind the Land</h3>
            <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

            <p> It is important to discuss the history of the Ojibwe and the Anishinabek people, which the Ojibwe are derived from. The Anishinabek are the Indigeous peoples of Michigan and the surrounding great lakes region, including Canada. The Anishinabek came from the people called the  Abenaki or Wabanaki that live in the Northeastern U.S., currently Maine. The Abenaki were called by seven prophets in 900 C.E. to begin The Great Walk from the East Coast to a new land , this is called the Seven Fires prophecies <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Ziibiwing- Home Page.” Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/.">(Ziibiwing Center).</a> The ones that pursued the journey of The Great Walk became the Anishinabek.</p>

            <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; float: right; width: 40%">
              <img src="img/Migration Map.jpeg" width="100%">
              <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Map showing the stops made during The Great Walk from Maine to the Midwest.

            </figure>
              <br>
          <p>The first prophet spoke of a turtle shaped island where food grows on water and foretold that seven tribes would be formed along the journey . The prophets warned that those that stayed would be destroyed. The subsequent prophets warned of the struggles that would come if the tribe accepted the ways of light skinned race <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Benton-Banai, Edward. The Mishomis Book: The Voice of the Ojibway. University of Minnesota Press, 2010.">(Benton-Banai)</a>. These prophecies were given to the spiritual sect of the Anishinabek called the Midewiwin. The Midewiwin were spiritually tasked with leading the people on the true path <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Tanton, TL. “Midewiwin.” The Canadian Encyclopedia, https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/midewiwin.">(Tanton).</a> The Midewiwin highly revere the sacred shell called the Megis shell, which is native to the South Pacific. They were told by the prophets that they would find Megis shells along the journey to signal stopping points in the journey. They found these shells, and Megis shells became the most sacred of objects along with otter pelts and their birch bark written scrolls.</p>
<br>
          <p>The Ojibwe tribe was officially created during the Three Fires Confederacy around 1200-1300 CE <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Ziibiwing- Home Page.” Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/.">(Ziibiwing Center).</a> The Confederacy was an alliance and deep bonding of the three tribes of Anishinabek, the Ojibwe, Odawa and the Potawatomi. The Ojibwe are considered the “Older Brother”, the Odawa the “Middle Brother” and the Potawatomi the “Younger Brother”. The three tribes had specific roles and functions in the Three Fires relationship, which were instrumental to the sustainability and health of the tribes <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Rubenstein, Bruce A., and Lawrence E. Ziewacz. Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State. Wiley, 2014.">(Rubenstein and Ziewacz).</a></p>
          <br>
            <p>The tribe that lived and used the land that MSU is now on is a tribe with a lineage of both Ottawa and Ojibwe descent. This genealogy was claimed by the Red Cedar River chief, Chief Okemas, who told of leading an Ojibwe contingent of an Ottawa band <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Montfort, Margaret Mary. Ethnic and tribal identity among the Saginaw Chippewa of nineteenth century Michigan. 1990.
">(Montfort, 56).</a> The Saginaw-Ojibwe tribe used and respected the land long before the MSU land grant. On what is now the MSU campus, the Saginaw-Ojibwe tribe would come encamp seasonally on the swampy land. The land was not a permanent home, but was importantly used for the gathering of wild rice called Manoomin in the late summer. Manoomin is sacred being the staple grain of the Anishinaabe Indigeous peoples and due to the important spiritual connections <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Mazina'igan Supplement.” GLIFWC, http://glifwc.org/publications/pdf/Ricing_Supplement.pdf.">(“Mazina'igan Supplement”).</a> The land was also used for hunting, sap collecting and trading. It is important to note that from the 1800 to 2005 there has been a 60-80% wetland loss in Ingraham county, leading to the wild rice in the area being destroyed <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Fizzell, Chad. “Status and Trends of Michigan's Wetlands: Pre-European Settlement to 2005.” State of Michigan, 23 July 2014, https://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/wrd-wetlands-status-trends_556006_7.pdf.">(Fizzell).</a> This is directly connected to the practice of settlers filling in swamps for the creation of cities, such as MSU's East Lansing. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The MSU campus archaeology program has been able to find out some information about the culture and practices of this tribe and previous tribes on what is now MSU land. The program has found a living space near the Beaumont tower area, which archaeologists consider to have been a sacred space <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Kooiman, Susan. “BEFORE MSU: EXPLORING THE PRE-CONTACT HISTORY OF MICHIGAN STATE.” MSU CAMPUS ARCHAEOLOGY PROGRAM.">(Kooiman)</a>. This evidence comes from stone and tool debris left at the site and the high and seasonal use of the Beaumont tower area. A map created in 1857, the first day of class at MSU, shows an “Indian Encampment,” which is marked by the river <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Painter, Jeff. “In the Beginning: Campus before MSU – MSU Campus Archaeology Program.” MSU Campus Archaeology Program, 21 September 2017, http://campusarch.msu.edu/?p=5494.">(Painter)</a>. This may be some of the last non-oral evidence of  presence on Indigenous present on MSU land before subsequently being pushed out.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The institution of Michigan State University has a strong history, including being the first land grant university. This is a point of excellence for the dominant culture and for the spread of education around the country. The story is not this simple and the history of the Morrill act and the displacement of the Saginaw-Ojibwe is not easy to digest. It is important to acknowledge the Anishinabek and Saginaw-Ojibwe communities for what their history is and equally as well as who they are now. The Ziibiwing Center is a great resource for learning more about the history and contemporary community of these great peoples.</p>
