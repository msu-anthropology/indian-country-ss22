<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>The intersection between feminism and human rights has been explored for many years, but far less attention has been paid to the work of Indigenous women and land rights and tribal sovereignty. The controversy surrounding “Land Grab” agricultural universities will be well known to anyone who studies land rights and the less-than-satisfactory practice of land acknowledgment without accountability, but not so much is known about the women who are at the forefront of this, and all, Native movements in the United States. Specifically, we are exploring the work of the Sogorea Te Land Trust, a women-led movement, and their efforts to regain the land taken from the Ohlone for the construction of UC Berkeley. It is important to recognize how female leaders have learned to integrate feminism into movements where many say there is no extra room among the complexities of sovereignty, some going as far as to claim there is no way to decolonize what had become white feminism in a way that can benefit the unique needs of Indigenous women. The women involved in these land-back movements prove that this is not the case, along with the aid of many Indigenous feminist scholars. </p>

<h2>Indigenous Feminism</h2>

    <p>Both feminism and ethnic studies have historically had a conspicuous gap where Native women should have fit. This is because many of the aims of both feminist and other minority groups tends to be at odds with Indigenous goals, because they seek complete independence as opposed to equality. Being recognized by the settler state would do little to assuage the very real issues that these communities face and could in fact be detrimental to them. “Native feminist theories offer new and reclaimed ways of thinking through not only how settler colonialism has impacted Indigenous and settler communities, but also how feminist theories can imagine and realize different modes of nationalism and alliances in the future” (Arvin 9). To avoid the risk of potentially despiritualizing and removing the key concept of Indigenous needs from feminism is a big task, but there are many who feel fit to take it on, such as the woman led Sogorea Te Land Trust fighting to regain land from UC Berkeley. </p>

    <p> Historically, the Indigenous political focus has been solely on the concept of sovereignty. Feminism, like many forms of civil rights activism, has been viewed as too white or too American to apply to the unique needs of tribes and their communities. The idea of seeking racial or gender equality within the confines of a different, American nation seems to undermine the concept of sovereignty and the separate needs of Indigenous people. However, this viewpoint overlooks the rampant sexism and gendered violence that Native women experience within their communities in favor of a focus on nation rights, which is neglectful of the needs of Indigenous women. There is a deeply rooted problem of misogyny and male power in tribal councils which, although it can be traced back to the westernized remaking of tribal structures, it does not erase its severe consequences, including violence against women that goes unpunished because of its perpetration by powerful men within the community (Ramirez 28). </p>

    <h3> Sogorea Te and Rematriation </h3>
    <p> The Sogorea Te Land Trust is An urban, Indigenous, woman-led trust based out of the San Francisco area that facilitates the return of Indigenous land, as well as the returning of cultural practices and the fight against the colonial heteropatriarchy. Although they work legally to regain land, such as the Ohlone land from UC Berkeley, they also have many programs and camps centered around Indigenous livelihood and especially teaching the urban youth how to return to traditional and cultural roots through interactions with the land. It is a diverse, intertribal movement that includes many different people and traditions, but within the spectrum of Indigenous feminism and the essentiality of the spirit and culture held by women, including, for example, the use of the word "rematriation" in place of the more common phrase, "repatriation" which erases the existence of these political female activists. Their primary goal is to restore the reciprocal relationship between the people, animals, environment, and the sacred Lisjan Ohlone land on which the Bay Area is situated (Sogorea Te Land Trust Purpose and Visions). </p>
    <p> The focus on the process of rematriation, rather than repatriation, is meant to reject and redefine the heteropatriarcal view of science and of Indigenous activism. In many tribes, lineage is traced through the mother, and many societies contained matriarcal structures that colonists worked hard to erase. The capturing of land juxtaposed with what is considered also the imprisonment and violence against female bodies on tribal land is a demonstration of the importance of intersectionality in these communities, and how sexism and racism, not just sovereignty, is part of the Indigenous woman's experience which the "white man's law" is not capable of addressing (Gray 3). The Sogorea Te Land Trust carries similar ideals and through efforts to restore culture, also works to restore female empowerment and the traditional rights of Indigenous women. </p>
<br></br>
  <p style="text-align:center"> “The loss of land plays out in our every day lives and it shapes how we look at things and how we feel about ourselves. We’ve spent 15 years in the Bay Area doing community organizing in the Indian community. And honestly, all the issues we’re struggling with come down to land. You know, the land was taken and that was such a deep soul wound. The taking of the land, the heart of the people, was the cause of a lot of problems. And I believe that with the land trust, and you know, the land itself, I think that’s really going to help us to find our way back.” </p></center>

<p> The Morrill Act was originally designed under the pretense of agricultural education. It was signed in 1862. In California, the University of Berkeley was gaining the right to obtain land for its campus. Henry Haight, the governor of the time, had signed the charter which led to the creation of UC Berkeley (Staff,2018). The land that Berkeley now sits upon was once the ancestral home to the Ohlone tribe. The land that the university now sits upon, was a sacred land site for the tribe. There are still areas being found on the campus that contain shellmounds from the native tribe. When NAGPRA had been signed into place, the university agreed to return the artifacts back to the tribe they belonged to, but only 3% of the artifacts have been repatriated to the tribe, with the university still in full grasp of the land as well.</p>

<p> When 1887 hit, the Dawes Act was put into place, so that native land would be broken up and allotted to different tribes (National Park Service). It was a very uneven distribution of land, so many indigenous people did not receive enough land to live properly. Only 480 acres of land were given to each of the heads of the Native tribes, which was not nearly enough acreage as before the land was taken (National Park Service). Native Americans were not allowed to receive any land unless they had registered with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which meant that they had to overcome many legal obstacles to become federally recognnized and eventually earn the right to regain a portion of their land. Though there have been new acts to give more rights to Native Americans, for instance NAGPRA, there are still many limitations within the legislation. By 1964, California's indigenous communities were now working towards landback movements to obtain their taken land. </p>

<p>When focusing on UC Berkeley, which was founded in 1868, most would not know it was a land grant university. The statement below is the university’s land acknowledgement:
“The American Indian Graduate Program and The Office of Graduate Diversity recognize that UC Berkeley sits on the territory of xučyun (Huichin), the original landscape of the Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people, the successors of the sovereign Verona Band of Alameda County.
This region continues to be of great importance to the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and other familial descendants of the Verona Band. We recognize that every member of the Berkeley community has, and continues to benefit from, the use and occupation of this land, since the institution’s founding in 1868. Consistent with our values of community, inclusion and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible the university’s relationship to Native peoples.
As members of the Berkeley Graduate Division community, it is vitally important that we not only recognize the history of the land on which we stand, but also, we recognize that the Muwekma Ohlone people are alive and flourishing members of the Berkeley and broader Bay Area communities today.” (Land, 2021)</p>

<p>This land acknowledgement states that the use of the land greatly benefits the university. It also states how they are responsible to make sure there is diversity and open discussion for the knowledge of the land grant. That being said, the university remains to limit the power of the indigenous people of the Ohlone tribe. For example, with NAGPRA now in place, the university has a responsibility to return all items to federally recognized tribes of the state and surrounding areas. UC Berkeley has only returned 20% of the stolen artifacts in their possession (Annika, 2020). There is a strong call for diversity within the campus walls, but there is little action being done to give equality and respect the land that was stolen from the indigenous community of the Ohlone tribe.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Further Reading</h2>
<p> The feminist movement, although long-denied its place in Indigenous studies, is now intrinsically linked with efforts of rematriation and the practices of sovereignty. it's first big movemen began in 1978, where a woman had protested for the rights of native women. From the beginning of the Morrill Act in 1862 to the founding of Sogorea Te in 2012, a wide, diverse range of Indigenous communities in the Bay Area have worked together to defend their traditional rights, dignity, and sovereignty as the colonial heteropatriarchy has attempted to undermine it. The first time a land back movement was put in place in California was in 1964. Many movements are now under female control to gain more rights for women and indigenous people as a whole. Without women such as those involved in the Sogorea Te Land Trust, there would be no land-back movement.
