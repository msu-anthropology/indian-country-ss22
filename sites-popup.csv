This dual dispossession is inseparable from and facilitated by the goal of capital accumulation. This project is an exploration of the history of dual dispossession, its impacts on the Anishinaabe Three Fires Confederacy, and how this historical injustice can be addressed.",<a href='sites/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
42.70187951733100,-84.48208607163240,<h3>Michigan State University as a Land-Grant University</h3>,<h4>Saginaw-Chippewa</h4>,"This project is going to focus on Michigan State University as a Land-Grant University by defining what it means to be a Land-Grant University/College and the history behind MSU being one of these universities. We are also going to look at the connection between the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribe and the land the MSU’s campus currently sits on. We will look at this connection using information from the Campus Archaeology program and their articles on their findings that point to Indigenous peoples inhabiting the land that the campus is on. We think it will be interesting to see the connection between the history of the university and the Indigenous people that once lived on the land, and how the Morrill Act changed the history of the land. This final project could be used to help to further educate people on the topic of MSU as a Land-Grant University and on the people that once lived on the land, and where they are today.

What is not well known is that Cornell University was created with funds diverted from the Morrill Act of 1862, which took land from Indigenous communities to fund universities across the nation. Was Ezra Cornell making decisions solely for the purpose of educational gain, or did he do it to build massive generational wealth at the expense of so many?","<a href='sites/Ezra-Cornell-and-the-Cayuga-Nation/Ezra-Cornell-and-the-Cayuga-Nation.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"
42.726033432028,-84.46564547714203,<h3>Promised vs Implemented Indigenous Resources at MSU</h3>,<h4>Native American Communities at MSU</h4>,"We are exploring the issues related to Native American communities at Michigan State University. We examine what resources Michigan State University offers to Native American students, faculty, and staff, especially how MSU has implemented the Native American tuition waiver. Through interviewing Native American students, faculty, staff, and tribal members, we investigate how MSU supports Indigenous communities and nations in Michigan, as stated in its Land Acknowledgement, as well as the struggles/solutions to recognize, support, and advocate for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Michigan. The interview questions include: the execution of Native American scholarship and tuition waiver, the application numbers versus enrollment rate of Indigenous students, the struggles of recruiting Native students, and personal experience of Indigenous members on campus. The interviews are based on the following literature: MSU full Land Acknowledgement, Intervention: Land Grab Universities Issue Native American and Indigenous Studies Journal, Waiver of Tuition for North American Indians Act 174 of 1976, Visibility of Indigenous Students in Michigan State University’s history, Debunking 10 misconceptions about Michigan’s Native Americans, and How the United States funded land-grant universities with expropriated Indigenous land – Michigan State University – High Country News.","<a href='sites/MSU-Indigenous-Recognition-and-Resources/MSU-Indigenous-Recognition-and-Resources.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

The LTBB have occupied the Michilimackinac area for thousands of years and have been in contact with European colonizers since the 17th century. This interaction has reduced much of the area to recognition as an area for tourism focusing on European and US history, taking focus away from recognition and repatriation of indigenous culture and history.",<a href='sites\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
