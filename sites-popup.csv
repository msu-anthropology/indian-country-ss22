37.871899,-122.258540,<h3>Feminism and Landgrab Universities</h3>,<h4></h4>,"The intersection between feminism and human rights has been explored for many years, but far less attention has been paid to the work of Indigenous women and land rights and tribal sovereignty. The controversy surrounding “Land Grab” agricultural universities will be well known to anyone who studies land rights and the less-than-satisfactory practice of land acknowledgment without accountability, but not so much is known about the women who are at the forefront of this, and all, Native movements in the United States. Specifically, we are exploring the work of the Sogorea Te Land Trust, a women-led movement, and their efforts to regain the land taken from the Ohlone for the construction of UC Berkeley. It is important to recognize how female leaders have learned to integrate feminism into movements where many say there is no extra room among the complexities of sovereignty, some going as far as to claim there is no way to decolonize what had become white feminism in a way that can benefit the unique needs of Indigenous women. The women involved in these land-back movements prove that this is not the case, along with the aid of many Indigenous feminist scholars.",<a href='sites/feminism-and-uc-berkeley/feminism-and-uc-berkeley.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School</h3>,<h4> Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy</h4>,"Through treaties with the U.S. Government, the Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy ceded land that was used to build Michigan State University and the Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School. Indian Boarding School were a creation of Richard Pratt, who intended to create schools that destroyed native children's ties with their culture, language and spirituality. Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding was created to dispossess Anishinabe children from their culture. Michigan State University is built on the ancestral lands of the Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy. This work is an exploration of the dually destructive impacts of simultaneous dispossession of tribal land and culture.",<a href='sites/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

We are also going to look at the connection between the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribe and the land the MSU’s campus currently sits on. We will look at this connection using information from the Campus Archaeology program and their articles on their findings that point to Indigenous peoples inhabiting the land that the campus is on. We think it will be interesting to see the connection between the history of the university and the Indigenous people that once lived on the land, and how the Morrill Act changed the history of the land. This final project could be used to help to further educate people on the topic of MSU as a Land-Grant University and on the people that once lived on the land, and where they are today.

What is not well known is that Cornell University was created with funds diverted from the Morrill Act of 1862, which took land from Indigenous communities to fund universities across the nation. Was Ezra Cornell making decisions solely for the purpose of educational gain, or did he do it to build massive generational wealth at the expense of so many?","<a href='sites/Ezra-Cornell-and-the-Cayuga-Nation/Ezra-Cornell-and-the-Cayuga-Nation.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

We examine what resources Michigan State University offers to Native American students, faculty, and staff, especially how MSU has implemented the Native American tuition waiver. Through interviewing Native American students, faculty, staff, and tribal members, we investigate how MSU supports Indigenous communities and nations in Michigan, as stated in its Land Acknowledgement, as well as the struggles/solutions to recognize, support, and advocate for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Michigan. The interview questions include: the execution of Native American scholarship and tuition waiver, the application numbers versus enrollment rate of Indigenous students, the struggles of recruiting Native students, and personal experience of Indigenous members on campus. The interviews are based on the following literature: MSU full Land Acknowledgement, Intervention: Land Grab Universities Issue Native American and Indigenous Studies Journal, Waiver of Tuition for North American Indians Act 174 of 1976, Visibility of Indigenous Students in Michigan State University’s history, Debunking 10 misconceptions about Michigan’s Native Americans, and How the United States funded land-grant universities with expropriated Indigenous land – Michigan State University – High Country News.","<a href='sites/sofia-loreina-project/sofia-loreina-project.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

The LTBB have occupied the Michilimackinac area for thousands of years and have been in contact with European colonizers since the 17th century. This interaction has reduced much of the area to recognition as an area for tourism focusing on European and US history, taking focus away from recognition and repatriation of indigenous culture and history.",<a href='sites\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
